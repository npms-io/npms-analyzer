Note that you must [setup](./docs/setup.md) the project before using the CLI. The most important commands will be described below. To discover the other ones run `$ npms-analyzer -h`.

### npms-analyzer observe

The `observe` command starts observing changes that occur in the `npm` registry as well as modules that were not analyzed for a while. Each reported module will be pushed into a queue to be processed by the queue consumers.

```bash
$ npms-analyzer observe --log-level debug | pino
```

For more information about the command, run `$ npms-analyzer observe -h`

### npms-analyzer consume

The `consume` command starts consuming the queue, running the analysis process for queued module.

```bash
$ npms-analyzer consume --log-level debug --concurrency 5 | pino
```

For more information about the command, run `$ npms-analyzer consume -h`

### npms-analyzer scoring

The `scoring` command, continuously iterates over the analysis results and calculates a score for all the `npm` modules, storing its result in `elasticsearch`.

```bash
$ npms-analyzer scoring
```

For more information about the command, run `$ npms-analyzer scoring -h`
