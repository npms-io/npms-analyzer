/**
 * Merges the package json with the downloaded one.
 *
 * The published package.json has higher priority than the one downloaded from the source code since it's more exact.
 * Though, some packages have pre-publish scripts that mutate the package.json hiding important stuff: one good example is
 * `bower`, which bundles dependencies in the package itself to speed up installation.
 *
 * The passed in `packageJson` will be mutated and it will be written out to the downloaded folder, overwriting the downloaded one.
 * The promise will be resolved with the original downloaded package json.
 *
 * @param {object} packageJson The package.json from the registry
 * @param {string} tmpDir      The temporary folder in which the package was downloaded
 *
 * @return {Promise} A promise that resolves with the downloaded package json
